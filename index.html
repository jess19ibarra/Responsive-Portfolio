                <p>Hey Y'all! My name is Jessica Ibarra pronounced (jeh-si-kuh i-bah-ruh). I prefer to be called "Jess"
                    because its shorter and I think Jessica sounds weird. Alot of people tend to pronounce my name with
                    a
                    "Y" instead of a "J" and then attempt to say my last name and completely butcher it. Now that you've
                    learned how to correctly pronounce my name, let me share a little synopsis about me.</p>

                <p> I'm not the most intresting person but I do know how to have a good time. Let's see I am 26 years
                    young
                    and have been living in Texas all of my life! I grew up in a hispanic household with wonderful
                    parent
                    and 2 brothers. I am the middle child, 4 years younger than my older brother and 18 years older than
                    my
                    little brother. I was
                    lucky to have a great childhood without struggles. After I graduated highschool in 2011 I decided to
                    go
                    to community college. I studied for a couple years but decided to make
                    work and not finish school. Fast foward to 2015 I found out I was pregnant and became a mother in
                    2016
                    to
                    the cutie in the picture. Her name is Emma and she is
                    my pride and joy, my little sour patch kid. Emma is 3 going on 13... send help! Totally kidding, she
                    is
                    beautiful, brave, and brilliant. She is what keeps me going everyday and the reason I am taking this
                    course. Most days I spend with family and friends. We like to have get togethers, watch sporting
                    events,
                    concerts or just have a good time. I love listening
                    to a variety of music, and just jam out. I love to travel, I just wish I had tons of money so it
                    could
                    happen more often.</p>

                <p>I currently have a full time job as a Business Analyst for a healthcare company. I have been working
                    in
                    healthcare for 7 years now. Which is why I am seeking a career chang and taking course. This is
                    definetly going to be challenging but im going to try my best and succeed!</p>
